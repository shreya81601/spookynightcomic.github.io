<b>PROJECT NAME</b><br>
Spooky Night 

<b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>SPOOKY NIGHT is a web-based comic, designed for halloween, which aims to create a friendly, enjoyable narrative for the purpose of entertainement. It outlines the story of two ghosts who talk about the human world on Halloween (as opposed to us humans thinking abouts ghosts on this occassional day). One of the ghosts - Pie - thinks that she is very smart, hence the other one - Pumpkin - decides to test her by asking a series silly joke-cum-riddles. Since, it is a prank played by Pumpkin on Pie, the user gets a sense that the questions won't be very legit, rather funny and stupid which are designed as such that one won't be able to guess them easily if they use 'common sense'. Consequently, we aimed to create a very cheerful, friendly website which would keep this theme in mind. As a process, we used very comicy and cartoonish illustrations which hint at the rustyness and unsophistication of the entire idea, giving it a playful vibe. We intend to keep it a light-hearted humour that is not very inense thus the choice of solid colors (with slight gradients) and block illustrations. The color pallete we used was inspired by the Halloween themed story and hence widely used colors like orange, white, black and purple. The jokes-cum-riddles themselves were not specifically halloween themed as halloween is being celebrated by the ghosts and not humans.</p>
<p>Keeping the user experience in mind, we purposefully did not want to add any buttons or menu options, because we wanted to keep the navigation very simple and easy, just limited to a scroll. As for the user interaction, we wanted the user to engage as much as possible, hence we decided that instead of having the 2 ghosts talk to each other and have riddles and answers displayed as callouts between them, we would have the website ask user the questions so that they also feel as a part of the comic. Guided by this idea, we made the storyline as such that the user feels they are competing with Pie. The ending message "Pie, did not pass, but did YOU?" is deliberately kept as such so that the user knows they are as important to us as the characters in our story. We didn't just want the user to read a comic, but feel like they are 'in' the comic and are a part of it. The interactions of the ghosts to the jokes-cum-riddles was put to add more drama and humourous character of the comic.</p>
